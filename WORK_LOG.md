| Sept 10 |  5:40-6:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                I tried to brainstorm on a whiteboard and convert it to comments on the file. Pretty confused and lost on how to get a good technique / strategy. |
| Sept 10 |   9-9:30pm    | I tried to continue to brainstorm the topic and struggled to come up with a feasible approach. I'm trying to think through how to do it recursively and am struggling. I started getting an allergic reaction right before this so this isn't my best work because I am really not feeling well. |
| Sept 11 | 10:55-11:25am |                                                                                                        Talked with Cody and ideated a new strategy - trying to find the clusters of cities when highwayCost < hospitalCost. Began coding the array of arrayLists that tracks the possible roads. |
| Sept 11 |  5:10-5:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Continued to code and tried to problem solve through "cluster" traversal. |
| Sept 11 |   8:10-9pm    |                                                                                                                                            Worked on creating an efficient method - got my code to accurately work on the first test but will not work for the other test cases - need to debug. |
