| Sept 10 |  5:40-6:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                I tried to brainstorm on a whiteboard and convert it to comments on the file. Pretty confused and lost on how to get a good technique / strategy. |
| Sept 10 |   9-9:30pm    | I tried to continue to brainstorm the topic and struggled to come up with a feasible approach. I'm trying to think through how to do it recursively and am struggling. I started getting an allergic reaction right before this so this isn't my best work because I am really not feeling well. |
| Sept 11 | 10:55-11:25am |                                                                                                        Talked with Cody and ideated a new strategy - trying to find the clusters of cities when highwayCost < hospitalCost. Began coding the array of arrayLists that tracks the possible roads. |
| Sept 11 |  5:10-5:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Continued to code and tried to problem solve through "cluster" traversal. |
| Sept 11 |   8:10-9pm    |                                                                                                                                            Worked on creating an efficient method - got my code to accurately work on the first test but will not work for the other test cases - need to debug. |
| Sept 14 |   3-3:40pm    |                                          I read through the reading and am trying to figure out how to correctly implement the union find algorithm. I initially copied down what the reading said and quickly realized that I dont think its fully applicable so I'm trying to figure that out. |
| Sept 14 |  3:45-4:15pm  |                                                                                                           Figured out how to get the find() function to work correctly and passed all tests, but now trying to figure out how to make fastfind() work correctly / how to make it more efficient. |
| Sept 14 |  4:15-4:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                            Figured out fastfind() right after. Next goal would be to figure out how to use halving or splitting. |
| Sept 16 |  9:15-9:30pm  |                                                                    I spent some time looking at some conceptual YouTube videos and rereading the reading handout to try to grasp how much more efficient it can become.. now trying to think about making fastfind() more efficient if possible. |
